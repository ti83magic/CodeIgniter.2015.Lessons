# CodeIgniter.2015.Lessons
All lessons from TM TI2.

This is a collection of premade projects I add code upon for educational purposes. PHP is new to me, so there's bound to be
errors, but there should be an inclining line in my progress. This is also the first time I'll use Github, so let's see where
we'll end up. Anyways, you are more than welcome to browse through the project :)
